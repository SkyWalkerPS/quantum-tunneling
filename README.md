```
npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser to preview the app

# File Structure

- CSS : Along with the React Component (either `.css` or `.scss` doesn't matter)
- Pages : `./src/` (written in `.jsx` or `.js` doesn't matter)
- Components : `./src/comp/` (written in `.jsx` or `.js` doesn't matter)
- Images : `./public/img/` (when referrencing in code, url should be `/img/`. eg. `./public/img/logo.svg` should be `/img/logo.svg`)

# Contributing Guidelines

- React Components **should** use Functional Components.
- Self Explanatory Code and/or Comments Explaining Code in detail (using Better Comments extension).
- Fetch Upstream in forked repository and pull before your coding sessions.
- Always contibute by making a different branch and adding your code there. The name of the branch can be either the feature's name (in camel case) or initials_DDMMYY (eg. `SP_010721`).
- Add any features or ideas to the [kanban board](https://github.com/resyfer/quantum-tunneling/projects/1)'s `In Progress` before trying to code it. In a similar manner, any feature ideas can be added to `To Do`.

# Pre-requisites
- HTML
- CSS
- Git/Github
- Vanilla JavaScript
- ReactJS (optional if you can understand patterns of existing code)

# Recommended Visual Studio Code Extensions
- ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets
- Auto Rename Tag
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- ESLint
- Better Comments

# TODO
All the development progress is visible at the [kanban board](https://github.com/resyfer/quantum-tunneling/projects/1). Move the card you're working with to appropriate sections.
